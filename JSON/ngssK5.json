Some organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms (both plants or plants parts and animals) and therefore operate as \"decomposers.\" Decomposition eventually restores (recycles) some materials back to the soil. Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met. A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life. Newly introduced species can damage the balance of an ecosystem."
